Welcome to Communiccino :)

You can check it on the Play Store. Feel free to contribute.

Sorry for poor documentation. I'll try the best I can to make this the best project in the whole world.

Also feel free to contact me at lgomes.leo@gmail.com, but pleaase use the keywords "Contribution" or "Communiccino" on the subject as I use it for filtering (too much spam).

I want to thank the people who developed usb-serial-for-android... It is the main component of this project, really.
